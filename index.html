        <p><img src="profet.jpg"alt="lovely"style=width:170px;height:170px;margin- right:15px;>its my favoIn the 
            ever-evolving landscape of haute couture, Asim Jofa emerges as a true luminary weaving master designs
             that effortlessly From the ladies conversations I hear, I feel that, all the dresses are very expensive including me. Besides, what they say sometimes makes me feel happy and proud of myself. I have heard many customers coming here that this place is very expensive, but this boutique is the best in the town. The worry and tiredness of staying here for so long gets full compensation. Every day there are at least forty to fifty visitors but, just eight to ten buy a dress or two.

             When customers talk that the dresses are very expensive here, I always wonder how have to stay here. I am quite happy here but several times I would like to get a change and go into a home. It’s not like that I am dissatisfied here but, the fact of being purchased by someone will surely give me a feeling of self-pride and pleasure. I and my friends often discuss about the boutique and its day to day activities.
             
             Most of my companions complain of getting bored, sitting quietly unattended and unattractive. I have also heard that, these days, fashion is changing very fast. At some times, I feel that we may get stagnated and soon may become out of fashion and then become discarded.

        Cosmetics have been part of human history for long. The word 'cosmetics' have been derived from the Greek 
        word meaning 'technique to dress and arrange'Cosmetics are composed of mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources or synthetically created ones.[1] Cosmetics have various purposes, including personal and skin care. They can also be used to conceal blemishes and enhance natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes). Makeup can also add colour to a person's face, enhance a person's features or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature, or object.[2]

        People have used cosmetics for thousands of years for skin care and appearance enhancement. Visible cosmetics for women and men have gone in and out of fashion over the centuries.

        I believe in comfortable shoes.
        
        One time I was walking to a party with these Steve Madden 7 inch nude pumps, totally fashionable. After 30 minutes I started experiencing pain in my sole. After 40 minutes, I couldn’t walk in them because of a developing blister. This forced me to take my shoes off and opt for a barefoot look, totally not fashionable. I believe in comfortable shoes because they changed my life.
        
        Unlike walking with high heels, comfortable shoes bring out the best in me. Yes, you may look skinny, taller and classier in those 6 inch heels, but lets be real, you don’t know how to walk in them. Take for example, my friend Laura. She recently had a job interview at General Electric. She was extremely qualified, spoke about her long term career goals, and showed her fantastic personality to go with those new Jessica Simspon’s black suede pumps.

            19-Oct-2022 — Erum Jewellers came into existence on April 2017 by the designer and founder 
            Mr. Mahammad Ali with the mission to provide quality gold and an excellent choice for vintage-inspired jewelry and simple, traditional designs because they suggest a slightly vintage, candlelit glamour. Someone who wanted, for instance, classic and traditional wedding jewelry with the “Grandma’s pearls” look would be attracted to jewelry that was accurately described this way.
